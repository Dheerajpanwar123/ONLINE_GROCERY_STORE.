# ONLINE_GROCERY_STORE.
The OnlineGroceryStore project aims to revolutionize the way groceries are delivered by reducing high delivery charges and creating local employment opportunities. In the current scenario, even ordering 1kg of potatoes can cost around â‚¹100 due to high delivery fees. This project proposes an optimized local delivery chain where each delivery partner covers only a 5 km radius.
Key Objectives:
Reduce delivery charges significantly
Build a chain-based local delivery model
Provide job opportunities to unemployed individuals
Make grocery delivery affordable and efficient for everyone
This system ensures quicker delivery, minimal logistics overhead, and promotes community-based earning by involving local delivery agents.
